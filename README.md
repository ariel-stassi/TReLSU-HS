# TReLSU-HS_database
In this work, we introduce TReLSU-HS, a new database for handshape recognition obtained from a previous public dataset of Uruguayan Sign Language called LÃ©xico TReLSU. We present here how TReLSU-HS was conformed and then describe the features of the resulting dataset.

The dataset is publicly available for direct download on the link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/fj7qve7g9big0wp/TReLSU-HS_database.rar?dl=0.
